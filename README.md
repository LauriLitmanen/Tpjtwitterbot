# TpjTwitterBot

## Tpj twitter bot tweets automatically when tpj match is about to start

### I wanted to learn some python and always forgot to use our teams twitter account. This little script got two birds with one stone.

Written in python using tweepy library. 

In a nutshell the program gets a match list from api.tpj.fi/api/data/upcoming and gets the starting time of the first list item and then tweets 10 minutes before the match starts.
